## Executive Summary: Bridging the "Trust Gap"

I am an AI Consultant & Scientist, helping Digital Health companies build technology that is transparent, explainable, and backed by real evidence. I focus on making sure your AI is used in a "good" way—meaning it follows best practices and provides results that users and investors can actually trust. With a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and over 40 peer-reviewed research publications, I provide the scientific proof and technical execution your product needs to move from a lab prototype to a market leader.
