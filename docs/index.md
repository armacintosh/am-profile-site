# AI Consultant & Scientist
## Grounding AI in Science & Transparency

Bridging the "Trust Gap" between technical execution and scientific integrity.

- **Scientific Validation**: Move from "it works in the lab" to market-ready evidence.

- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Turn black-box models into transparent, trustworthy systems.

- **Risk & Ethics**: Align with national standards (CAN/DGSI 101) and global best practices.

- **Funding Success**: Secure R&D grants with valid technical and scientific proposals.

## About Me

I am an **AI Consultant & Scientist** helping Digital Health companies build trust through rigorous validation and Explainable AI (XAI). With a **PhD in Biomedical Engineering** and a focus on "AI for Good," I help teams prove that their innovations are reliable, fair, and effective.

Whether you need a peer-reviewed validation study, a deep-dive data analysis, or a strategy to secure non-dilutive funding, I provide the scientific proof and technical execution required to move your product from a prototype to a category leader.
